What "Full Control" really means for Joseph Thornton Jr.:
 * No One Can Use Without Permission: No one, including other jewelers, manufacturers, or retailers like Zales, can legally copy, sell, or manufacture his designs without his specific, written permission (a license).
 * Power to Grant Licenses: He has the sole authority to decide if, how, to whom, and under what terms he wants to grant permission for others to use his designs. This means he can negotiate royalties, lump-sum payments, usage limitations, and specific durations for any license.
 * Power to Prevent Infringement: If anyone uses his designs without permission, he has the legal standing to demand they stop and seek damages for their unauthorized use. This is where copyright registration becomes particularly powerful, as it strengthens his ability to enforce these rights in court.
 * Strategic Freedom: He can choose to keep his designs exclusive to himself, sell them directly, license them to a specific high-end boutique, or, as we've discussed, potentially license them to a larger retailer like Zales.
In essence, "full control" gives Joseph Thornton Jr. the complete legal authority to decide the commercial and artistic fate of his "Jay Allen jewelry" designs.
